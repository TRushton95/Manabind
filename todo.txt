Change event names into class of enums

LoadListItems selected item must scroll
	(or the whole thing should be reworked, would benefit from a better event system)

Event system requires sending of click events even when element is blocked, eg.
	sender="save-container"
	eventtype="LeftClick"
	blocked="true"

	-this allows use of block-specific behaviour while still allowing click events to occur

Don't want to rebuild entire page for tile change, this may come back to bite me

Do BasicComponents need to be listeners?
	-Don't think they do, changes are propogated from ComplexComponents

Add Id and ParentId to Listener
	-RemoveNode functionality to EventManager (recursive remove if parentId)

--------------------------

AppState is not re-added automatically after a refreshTree() call
	-Currently manually resubscribing it after each refreshTree call, not a clean way of handling it

--------------------------

HighlightIcon draw is being duplicated in Toolbar and EditorAppState

Is highlightedTile being used in EditorAppState?
