Change event names into class of enums

LoadListItems selected item must scroll
	(or the whole thing should be reworked, would benefit from a better event system)

Event system requires sending of click events even when element is blocked, eg.
	sender="save-container"
	eventtype="LeftClick"
	blocked="true"

	-this allows use of block-specific behaviour while still allowing click events to occur

Don't want to rebuild entire page for tile change, this may come back to bite me
