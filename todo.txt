Change draw approach
	-Draw only draws itself and child base components
	-ComponentManager draws all base complex components in list

Root container should not be a base component inheritant
	-Doesn't draw or hover
	-Only provides parent boundaries (not strictl true, see below)
	-Should it even exist???

	-Must then consider how hiding affects child components

Look into event sending/recieving/executing system
	-See if there is a simpler approach

Find Hover/Leave approach where Hover doesn't surface where it shouldn't

What does heading do when altering height?

Investigate possibility of defining AppState EventResponse behaviour in xml too
	-Probably not possible though, as that requires game states setting up through xml
	-Separation of UI and game or something

Make an initialiseDetail method for complex components
	-Make a better name for it too

Rename default BaseComponent properties to have "Default" in front for clarity

Create flag for hoverable (could re-use interactive?) to decide whether to bother switching BaseComponents
