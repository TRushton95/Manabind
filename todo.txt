Change draw approach
	-Draw only draws itself and child base components
	-ComponentManager draws all base complex components in list

Root container should not be a base component inheritant
	-Doesn't draw or hover
	-Only provides parent boundaries (not strictl true, see below)
	-Should it even exist???

	-Must then consider how hiding affects child components

Refactor EventsAreEqual out into utility class
	-Doesn't belong there

Look into event sending/recieving/executing system
	-See if there is a simpler approach

Find Hover/Leave approach where Hover doesn't surface where it shouldn't
